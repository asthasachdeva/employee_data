Absence Management System (Flutter)
Overview
This Flutter application allows users to view, manage, and filter employee absences. The app provides a clean, efficient way to track absence data, including the ability to filter by absence type and date, paginate the results, and export absence details to an iCal file for integration with calendar applications such as Outlook.

Features
1. Absence List
Displays a list of absences, including the following details for each entry:
Member Name: Name of the employee.
Type of Absence: Type of absence (e.g., Sick, Vacation, etc.).
Period: The duration of the absence (start and end dates).
Member Note: Any note provided by the employee (if available).
Status: Current status of the absence, which can be one of the following:
Requested: The absence is requested but not confirmed.
Confirmed: The absence is confirmed.
Rejected: The absence is rejected.
Admitter Note: Note provided by the person who admitted or confirmed the absence (if available).
2. Pagination
The application initially shows the first 10 absences, with the ability to paginate to the next set of records.
3. Absence Count
The total number of absences is displayed at the top of the list.
4. Filters
Filter by Type: Filters absences based on the absence type (e.g., Sick, Vacation).
Filter by Date: Filters absences by a specific date or date range.
5. States
Loading State: While the data is being fetched, a loading indicator will be displayed.
Error State: In case of an issue retrieving the list, an error message will be shown.
Empty State: If no absences match the applied filters, an empty state message will be displayed.
6. iCal Export (Bonus Feature)
The application provides the option to generate an iCal (.ics) file for the displayed absences, which can be imported into Outlook or other calendar applications.
Tech Stack
Flutter: A framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
State Management: BLoC (Business Logic Component) for handling the state of the app. Alternative options like Provider or Riverpod can be used.
Testing: Flutter's built-in flutter_test library for unit and widget testing.
Code Linter: Dart’s built-in analyzer with custom rules for code style and quality.
Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
git clone <repository_url>
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy
cd <project_directory>
flutter pub get
3. Run the Application
Run the Flutter application on an emulator or a physical device.

bash
Copy
flutter run
4. Tests
To run the tests for the application, execute the following command:

bash
Copy
flutter test
This will run all the unit and widget tests to ensure the application is functioning as expected.

Instructions for Use
Viewing Absences: Upon opening the app, the first 10 absences will be displayed. You can navigate through the pages using the pagination controls.

Filtering: Use the filter options at the top of the screen to filter the absences by type (e.g., Sick, Vacation) and by date range.

Generating iCal File: Once you have applied the desired filters and are viewing the absences, you can generate an iCal (.ics) file by clicking the "Generate iCal" button. This file can then be imported into Outlook or another calendar application.

Folder Structure
The folder structure for the application follows a clean architecture with an emphasis on maintainability and scalability:

bash
Copy
lib/
├── blocs/               # BLoC state management
├── models/              # Data models (Absence, Member, etc.)
├── screens/             # UI screens
│   ├── absence_list.dart  # Absence listing screen
│   └── filters.dart       # Filter screen
├── widgets/             # Reusable widgets
│   ├── absence_card.dart  # Card to display each absence
│   └── pagination.dart    # Pagination controls
└── main.dart            # Main entry point
test/
├── widgets/             # Unit tests for widgets
├── blocs/               # Unit tests for BLoC
└── models/              # Unit tests for models
Code Quality
Naming Conventions: The application follows Dart and Flutter's standard naming conventions for files, functions, classes, and variables.
Code Structure: The app is structured into distinct layers (BLoC, Models, UI, etc.) to ensure clear separation of concerns and scalability.
Performance: Optimized for smooth scrolling and responsiveness, especially when dealing with large sets of data.
Testing: The app is thoroughly tested with unit tests for models, widget tests for UI components, and integration tests for overall functionality.
Commits and Versioning
Commit Early and Often: Throughout the development process, commits should be frequent to ensure code is versioned properly and to demonstrate progress.
Commit Messages: Use clear, concise commit messages to describe the changes made.
Example commit message:

vbnet
Copy
feat: Add pagination to the absence list
Optional Bonus: Deploying to GitHub Pages
To deploy the Flutter app to GitHub Pages (as a static web app), you can use the flutter build web command to generate the static files and then upload them to a GitHub repository's gh-pages branch. Here are the basic steps:

Build the app for web:

bash
Copy
flutter build web
Push the build files to the gh-pages branch:

bash
Copy
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
cp -r build/web/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages
For more detailed instructions, refer to Flutter's documentation on deploying to the web.

Conclusion
This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee absences with powerful filtering options, pagination, and iCal export capabilities. It is built using Flutter for cross-platform support, and it's designed with clean architecture and tested thoroughly.
